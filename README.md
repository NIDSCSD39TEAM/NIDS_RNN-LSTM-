# Detecting Network Intrusion Anomalies withRNN(LSTM)-Based Deep Learning Models

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

## Overview

This repository contains a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) implemented using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The goal is to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the detection of network security threats and intrusions.

## Features

- **RNN-LSTM Architecture:** Utilizes the power of Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory for sequence modeling, enabling the system to capture temporal dependencies in network data.

- **Anomaly Detection:** The NIDS is designed to identify anomalous patterns in network traffic, allowing for the detection of potential security threats.

- **Adaptive Learning:** The system adapts to evolving threats by continuously learning from network data, providing a more dynamic and proactive defense mechanism.
